In this project I am using Observer Design Pattern to notify the company when an investor want to buy a share.
In this scenario, both company and investor implements an interface called Trade, that contains only
one method called deal.
the investor is the observable and the company is the observer. when an investor buy from a company,
this company will be notified.
